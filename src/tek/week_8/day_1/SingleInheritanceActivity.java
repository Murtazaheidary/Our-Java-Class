/*    Scenario:

    Imagine a library system where every book has some general properties but specific types of books might have additional unique
    attributes. Your task is to design classes using single inheritance to represent this scenario.

    Question 1: Design a Generic Book Class

    Create a superclass named Book.
    Properties: title, author, numberOfPages.

    Methods:

    1. read(): Prints out "Reading [title] by [author]."
    2. close(): Prints out "Closing the book."

    - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *


    Question 2: Create a Specialized Book Class

    Create a subclass named AudioBook that extends the Book class.
    Properties: durationInHours, narrator (in addition to the properties it inherits from Book).

    Methods:

    1. listen(): Prints out "Listening to [title] narrated by [narrator]."
    2. Make use of the read() method to indicate when someone starts listening to the audiobook.



   - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *


    Question 3: Test Your Classes

    Create an instance of the AudioBook class.
    Set its properties (including the ones inherited from Book).
    Call the listen() and close() methods on the AudioBook instance. What output do you expect?


  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *  - * - * - *
