/*    Scenario:

    In the modern world, we have various electronic devices. These devices have some general properties, but each type of
    device can have its unique characteristics. Your task is to model this scenario using Java classes and single inheritance.

    Question 1: Design a Generic Device Class

    Create a superclass named Device.
    Properties: brand, model, powerSupply (e.g., "Battery" or "Mains").

    Methods:

    turnOn(): Prints out "[brand] [model] is turning on."
    turnOff(): Prints out "[brand] [model] is turning off."

    Question 2: Design a Specialized Smartphone Class

    Create a subclass named Smartphone that extends the Device class.
    Properties: operatingSystem, screenSize, cameraResolution (in addition to the properties it inherits from Device).

    Methods:
    takePhoto(): Prints out "Taking a [cameraResolution] MP photo with the [brand] [model]."
    Use the turnOn() method to indicate the smartphone is powered on.

    Question 3: Test Your Classes

    Create an instance of the Smartphone class.
    Set its properties (including those inherited from Device).
    Call the takePhoto() and turnOff() methods on the Smartphone instance. What output do you expect?
