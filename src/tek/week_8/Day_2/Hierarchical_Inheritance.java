    Real-life Analogy:

    Consider a tree in nature. The tree has a main trunk, which then branches out into several large branches, and each of these
    branches may further have smaller branches or twigs. Each branch or twig shares the common source of nutrients from
    the main trunk, but they all grow in different directions and might bear different fruits or flowers.

    Here:

    The main trunk represents the base class.

    The large branches and twigs represent derived classes, inheriting properties from the same base class but possibly having
    different attributes or functions.

    Programming Explanation:

    In hierarchical inheritance, one class serves as a base class for more than one derived class. While the derived classes
    inherit the features from the base class, they are free to introduce their specific features.
