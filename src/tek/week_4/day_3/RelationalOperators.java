    Imagine you're lining up books on a shelf based on their heights. You will need
    to compare the heights of these books to decide their positions: which book is taller,
     which one is shorter, and which ones are of equal height.


        Java-related explanation:

        Relational operators are used in Java to compare two values and establish a
        relationship between them:


    > (Greater Than): Checks if the value on the left is greater than the one on the right.
    < (Less Than): Checks if the value on the left is less than the one on the right.
    >= (Greater Than or Equal To): Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the one on the right.
    <= (Less Than or Equal To): Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the one on the right.
