/*
    Real-Life Analogy:

    Imagine you're listening to a playlist of songs. If a song starts playing that you don't like, you skip it
    to move to the next one. The act of skipping the song is akin to the continue statement in loops.

    Example: Print all numbers from 1 to 10, but skip even numbers.

    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {

        if (i % 2 == 0) {   // If the number is even,
         continue;      // skip the rest of the loop body.
        }
     System.out.println(i);  // This will only print odd numbers.
    }
