/*
Variables in Java are like containers or boxes where you can store information.
Imagine you're moving to a new house. You'd use boxes to pack different types of
items: books, dishes, clothes, etc.
 You might even label these boxes so that you know what's inside each one without having to open it up.
*/


/*
You have to give each variable a name so you can use it later in your program.
There are rules and best practices for naming:

        Variable names should be descriptive (e.g., userName, totalAmount).
        They cannot start with numbers or special characters except for underscores or dollar signs.
        Java is case-sensitive, so age and Age would be different variables.

Types of Variables

        1. Local Variables: These are like boxes you only use in one room (within a method)
        and aren't available elsewhere.

        2. Instance Variables: Imagine a box that belongs to the entire house and can be
         accessed from any room.
         These variables belong to an object and are available to all methods within the same class,
         as long as they are called on the same object.

        3. Class Variables: Also known as static variables,
        these are like community boxes that are shared among all instances (objects) of a class.
