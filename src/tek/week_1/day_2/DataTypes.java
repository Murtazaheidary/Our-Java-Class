/*    Data Types: Just like you wouldn't put liquids in a cardboard box, each variable in Java has a specific
        "type" that tells us what kind of data it can hold.

        The primary types include:

            1. int for integers (numbers): int age = 25;
            2. double for floating-point (decimal) numbers: double height = 5.9;
            3. char for single character: char grade = 'A';
            4. boolean for true/false values: boolean isOnline = true;
            5. String for text (note that String is actually a class, not a primitive type, but it)


   Once you've declared a variable, you can put data in it (this is called "initializing" the variable),
   and you can change that data later on:

    int age;      // Declare
    age = 30;     // Initialize
    age = 35;     // Modify
