// What is console?

/*
 * Think of the console like the dashboard in your car. 
 * Just like you can see
 * your speed, fuel level, 
 * and other important information on your car's
 * dashboard, the console in programming provides 
 * you with real-time text-based
 * output for what your code is doing.
