/*
 * Imagine you're an artist. You could technically paint
 * on any surface using any kind of brush or even your 
 * fingers, but having a proper canvas, easel,
 * and a set of brushes makes the job a whole lot 
 * easier and more organized.
 * Similarly, when you're writing Java code 
 * (or code in other languages), you could be use a 
 * basic text editor like (notepad), but an Integrated 
 * Development Environment(IDE) like 
 * Eclipse offers a much more powerful and 
 * convenient workspace.
