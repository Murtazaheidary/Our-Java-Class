    Real-Life Analogy: Building Blocks and Actions

    Imagine you're playing with a set of toy building blocks, like LEGOÂ®. Each unique block design can be thought of
    as a class. It represents a blueprint or a mold, but not the individual LEGO pieces themselves. If you want a specific
    LEGO piece, you'd use the mold or blueprint to produce it. Similarly, an instance of a class (or an object) is like
    an individual LEGO piece you've created using a specific block design or mold.

    Now, each of these LEGO designs might have associated actions. For example, you might have a LEGO car, and the
    associated actions could be 'move forward' or 'turn lights on'. These actions are like methods in OOP. So,
    while the design of the LEGO piece (class) gives it its shape and attributes, the methods dictate what
    actions you can perform with it.

    In the real world, using these LEGO molds (classes) is efficient because:

    Reusability: Instead of designing a car from scratch each time, you use an existing design (class) to create
     many cars (objects).

    Organization: It's easier to manage designs and actions when they're grouped together. You know precisely what
    each design is capable of and what actions are associated with it.

    Modification: If you decide to modify the design of the car, you only have to change the blueprint or mold (class).
    All future cars (objects) made from that modified mold will automatically have the new design.

    Programming Explanation:

    In programming, using classes and methods offers similar benefits:

    Reusability: Once a class is defined, it can be used to create multiple objects. Instead of rewriting code for
    each new object, you simply instantiate a new instance of the class. This makes your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

    Organization: Classes and methods help in organizing your code. When you see a class named Car, you have a clear
    idea of what it represents. Methods inside the Car class, like accelerate() or turnOnLights(), give clarity on
    the actions or behaviors associated with a car.

    Encapsulation: One of the fundamental principles of OOP. By bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions)
    that operate on the data into a single unit (or class), you can control the access and modification of the data.
    It ensures that the data is safe and only accessible through well-defined interfaces (methods).

    Modification: If there's a need to change how a car behaves or add new features, you only have to modify the Car class.
    All objects created from this class will inherit these changes, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors.
