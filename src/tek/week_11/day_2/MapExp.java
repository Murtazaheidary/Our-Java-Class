    The Map interface in Java is part of the Collections Framework and represents a mapping between a key and a value. A Map cannot
    contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value. Here are some key points to understand about Map:

    1. It is not a subtype of the Collection interface. Therefore, it behaves a bit differently from the rest of the collection types.
    2. A Map provides key to value mapping for storing elements.
    3. Elements are stored as key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
    4. A Map is useful when you want to access, insert, or delete elements based on a key.
    5. Commonly used implementations of the Map interface include HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, and Hashtable.

    Here's a real-life analogy and a programming explanation:

    Real-life analogy:

    Think of a Map like a dictionary. Each word in the dictionary (the key) has a specific definition (the value). Just like a
    dictionary, where you can find the definition for a word, in a Map, you can find a value based on its key. Also, just like a
    word appears only once in a dictionary, a key is unique in a Map.

    Programming Explanation:

    In programming, you might use a Map to associate objects with other objects. For instance, if you have a list of student IDs
    and associated names, you can store the IDs as keys and the names as values. Using the student ID, you can quickly retrieve
    the student's name.
