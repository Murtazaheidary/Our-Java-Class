/*    Activity 1: TreeSet Basics

    Objective: To familiarize students with the creation of a TreeSet, adding elements, and traversing through the TreeSet to
    understand the ordering of elements.

    Steps:

    Create a TreeSet of type String.
    Add at least five string elements to the TreeSet, which could be the names of different fruits.
    Use a foreach loop to print out all elements in the TreeSet and observe the order in which they are printed.
    Add a few more elements and notice how the order changes.
    Print out the first and last element in the TreeSet.
    Remove an element from the TreeSet and print out the remaining elements.*/
