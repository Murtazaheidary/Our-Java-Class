/*    Activity 2: Common Elements Finder

    Objective: Given two arrays of strings, find the common elements and print them out.

    Steps:

    Initialize two string arrays with predefined values. ( String[] array1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig", "apple"};
    String[] array2 = {"grape", "melon", "fig", "cherry"};) These arrays may contain duplicates.
    Create two HashSet objects for each array to remove any duplicates and to facilitate easy comparison.
    Add all elements from both arrays into their respective HashSets.
    Use the retainAll() method to find the common elements between the two sets.
    Print out the common elements.
