/*    Activity 1: Unique Name Register

    Objective: Create a program that registers names entered by the user, but it must ignore any duplicate names.

    Steps:

    Initialize a HashSet to store names.
    Create a loop that allows the user to enter names.
    After each name is entered, attempt to add it to the HashSet.
    Inform the user whether the name was added or if it was a duplicate and therefore not added.
    The loop can be exited when the user enters a specific word (e.g., "exit").
    Finally, print out all the unique names that were entered.
