    Upcasting:

    Real-life analogy:

    Imagine you have different types of vehicles: cars, bicycles, trucks, etc. Now, if you're just concerned with categorizing them as
    vehicles and don't care about the specific type, you're essentially generalizing them. This is similar to upcasting.

    Programming Explanation:

    Upcasting is the process of converting a subclass reference into a superclass reference. In Java, this happens automatically when
    a child class object is assigned to a parent class reference.



    The advantage of upcasting is that you can use a generalized reference to refer to any of its subclass objects. However, using the
    superclass reference, you can only access methods and variables of the superclass and not any specific functionalities of the
    subclass.
