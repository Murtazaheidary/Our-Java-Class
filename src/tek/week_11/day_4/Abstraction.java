    Abstraction

    Real-life Analogy:

    Imagine a car. When you drive a car, you don't need to know how its engine works, how its transmission system shifts gears, or how
    its braking system functions. You just need to know how to operate it, like turning the ignition on, pressing the pedals, and
    steering the wheel. The internal complexities of how the car functions are hidden from the driver. This is a form of abstraction.

    Explanation in Programming:

    In OOP, abstraction refers to the idea of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary
    features of that system. This helps in reducing complexity and at the same time, it helps in increasing efficiency.

    For instance, when you use a class method in Java (or any other OOP language), you often don't need to know how that method works
    internally. You just need to know what it does. The internal workings (the code inside the method) are abstracted away from you.


    Key Points of Abstraction:

    1. Hiding Complexity: Just as you don't need to understand the complexities of how a car's engine works to drive it, a user of a class
    (or method) doesn't need to know its internal workings to use it.

    2. Interface vs Implementation: In programming, the interface of a class (methods and properties an object exposes) represents its
    abstraction. The actual code within the class represents its implementation. Good software design ensures that these two are kept
    separate.

    3. Increased Efficiency: Abstraction allows developers to reduce the complexity of viewing things and presents a clear and simple
    view of an object in terms of its functionality to the outer world.

    4. Flexibility: With the internal details hidden away by abstraction, changes can often be made to the internals of a class
     or method without affecting code that uses it. This is because the interface remains consistent, even if the underlying
     implementation changes.

    In Java:

    Java, like many OOP languages, provides mechanisms to create abstract classes and methods. An abstract class in Java cannot
    be instantiated, and it may contain abstract methods (methods without a body). The purpose of an abstract class is to be
    extended by other classes to provide a concrete implementation of those abstract methods.
