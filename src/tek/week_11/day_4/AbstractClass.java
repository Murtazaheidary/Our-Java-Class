    Abstract Class

    Real-life Analogy:

    Think of an abstract class as a blueprint for a house. This blueprint defines the essential elements that every house should have,
    such as rooms, a roof, and a foundation. However, the blueprint does not define the specifics, like the color of the rooms, the type
    of roof tiles, or the exact layout. Just as you can't live in a blueprint, you can't create an instance of an abstract class.
    The blueprint serves as a guideline for builders to design and construct various types of houses based on that foundational plan.

    Explanation in Programming:

    In Java and many other object-oriented programming languages, an abstract class serves as a base class that cannot be instantiated
    on its own. It can only be subclassed. The abstract class can declare abstract methods that have no body, effectively setting a
    contractual obligation for any child class to provide a concrete implementation for these abstract methods.

    Key Characteristics of an Abstract Class:

    1. Cannot be Instantiated: You cannot create an object of an abstract class using the new keyword. Its sole purpose is to be extended
    (inherited) by other classes.

    2. Can Contain Abstract Methods: Abstract methods in an abstract class have no body (implementation). It's a way of ensuring that any
    subclass will provide a specific implementation for this method.

    3. Can Contain Concrete Methods: Apart from abstract methods, an abstract class can have methods with a body (concrete methods),
    properties, and constructors.

    4. Contractual Obligation: When a regular (non-abstract) class extends an abstract class, it is contractually obliged to implement
    all the abstract methods declared in the abstract class, unless the subclass is also abstract.
