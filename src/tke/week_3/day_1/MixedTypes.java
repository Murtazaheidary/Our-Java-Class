    Imagine you're baking cookies. You have different ingredients: 3.5 cups of flour, 2 eggs,
    and 1.5 cups of sugar. Now, even though the quantities and measurements of these ingredients
     differ, you can mix them all together to make cookie dough. Some ingredients are whole numbers
     (like eggs), while others might be fractions or decimals (like cups of flour or sugar). Yet,
     they all come together harmoniously in the recipe.

    In Java, when you're performing operations that involve different data types, this is referred
     to as "mixed-type" computation. The system has to decide on a "common" data type to which all
     others will be converted before the operation is executed. This is done to ensure compatibility
     and prevent data loss.

    Here's a general rule for mixed-type computation in Java:

    If one of the operands is double, the other is converted to double.
    Otherwise, if one of the operands is float, the other is converted to float.
    Otherwise, if one of the operands is long, the other is converted to long.
    Otherwise, both operands are converted to int.

        System.out.println("Float max range: " + Float.MAX_VALUE);
        System.out.println(Long.MAX_VALUE);
        System.out.println("Double max: " + Double.MAX_VALUE);
    }
